# # Storage Device Selection
#
# This tutorial describes the storage device options in `Acquire`.
#
# ## Description of Storage Devices
#
# To start, we'll create a `Runtime` object and print the storage device options.

# +
import acquire

# Instantiate a Runtime object
runtime = acquire.Runtime()

# Instantiate a DeviceManager object for the Runtime
dm = runtime.device_manager()

# Print devices in DeviceManager of kind Storage
for device in dm.devices():
    if device.kind == acquire.DeviceKind.Storage:
        print(device)
# -
# The output of that script will be:
#
# ```
# <DeviceIdentifier Storage "raw">
# <DeviceIdentifier Storage "tiff">
# <DeviceIdentifier Storage "trash">
# <DeviceIdentifier Storage "tiff-json">
# <DeviceIdentifier Storage "Zarr">
# <DeviceIdentifier Storage "ZarrBlosc1ZstdByteShuffle">
# <DeviceIdentifier Storage "ZarrBlosc1Lz4ByteShuffle">
# ```
#
# `Acquire` supports streaming data to [bigtiff](http://bigtiff.org/) and [Zarr V2](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec/v2.html).
#
# Zarr has additional capabilities relative to the basic storage devices, namely _chunking_, _compression_, and _multiscale storage_. You can learn more about the Zarr capabilities in `Acquire` [here](https://github.com/acquire-project/acquire-driver-zarr).
#
# - **raw** - Streams to a raw binary file.
#
# - **tiff** - Streams to a [bigtiff](http://bigtiff.org/) file. Metadata is stored in the `ImageDescription` tag for each frame as a `JSON` string.
#
# - **trash** - Writes nothing. Discards incoming data. Useful for live streaming applications.
#
# - **tiff-json** - Stores the video stream in a [bigtiff](http://bigtiff.org/), and stores metadata in a `JSON` file. Both are located in a folder identified by the `filename` property.
#
# - **Zarr** - Streams data to a [Zarr V2](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec/v2.html) file with associated metadata.
#
# - **ZarrBlosc1ZstdByteShuffle** - Streams compressed data (_zstd_ codec) to a [Zarr V2](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec/v2.html) file with associated metadata.
#
# - **ZarrBlosc1Lz4ByteShuffle** - Streams compressed data (_lz4_ codec) to a [Zarr V2](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec/v2.html) file with associated metadata.
#
# ## Configure the Storage Device
#
# In the example below, the the `tiff` storage device is selected, and the data from one video source will be streamed to a file `out.tif`.

# +
# get the current configuration
config = runtime.get_configuration()

# Select the tiff storage device
config.video[0].storage.identifier = dm.select(acquire.DeviceKind.Storage, "tiff")

# Set the data filename to out.tif in your current directory (provide the whole filetree to save to a different directory)
config.video[0].storage.settings.filename = "out.tif"
# -

# Before proceeding, complete the `Camera` setup and call `set_configuration` to save those new configuration settings.
