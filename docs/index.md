## Background

Cloud-native file streaming solutions (e.g. file writers) are essential for building efficient image data acquisition
workflows, especially when acquiring more data than fits into memory or a single external hard drive.
[Zarr](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specs.html) is a cloud-native data format that supports imaging data
and has strong early adoption within the imaging community. The [Acquire project](https://github.com/acquire-project) developed
this standalone Zarr streaming library with bindings in both python and C. This library easily integrates into custom
acquisition workflows since it does not rely on runtime or hardware support.

## Installation

### Install the Python library
