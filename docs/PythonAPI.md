# API Reference

Information on the classes in `acquire-imaging` along with the attributes and methods associated with them.

## Class `AvailableData`

The `AvailableData` class represents the collection of frames that have been captured since the last call to runtime.get_available_data(). `AvailableData` objects should be set to have a short lifetime, since these objects reserve space on the video queue and will eventually block camera acquisition to ensure no data is overwritten before it can be processed.

```python
class AvailableData:
    def frames(self) -> Iterator[VideoFrame]:
        """Returns an iterator over the video frames in the available data."""
    
    def get_frame_count(self) -> int:
        """Returns the total number of video frames in the available data."""
    
    def __iter__(self) -> Iterator[VideoFrame]:
        """Returns an iterator over the video frames in the available data."""
```
- Call `get_frame_count()` to query the number of frames in an `AvailableData` object. 

- The `frames` method provides an iterator over these frames.

## Class `Camera`
The `Camera` class is used to describe cameras or other video sources.

```python
class Camera:
    identifier: Optional[DeviceIdentifier]
    settings: CameraProperties

    def __init__(self, *args: None, **kwargs: Any) -> None: ...
    """Initializes a Camera object with optional arguments."""
    
    def dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]: ...
    """Returns a dictionary of the Camera attributes."""
```

- `identifier`: An optional attribute which contains an instance of the `DeviceIdentifier` class that describes the camera, or video source, if that device is natively supported. Otherwise, it is of type `None`.

- `settings`: An instance of the `CameraProperties` class which contains the settings for the camera.

- The `dict` method creates a dictionary of a `Camera` object's attributes.

## Class `CameraProperties`
The `CameraProperties` class is used to set the desired camera properties for acquisition.

```python
class CameraProperties:
    exposure_time_us: float

    pixel_type: SampleType
    readout_direction: Direction
    offset: Tuple[int, int]
    shape: Tuple[int, int]
    input_triggers: InputTriggers
    output_triggers: OutputTriggers

    def dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]: ...
    """Returns a dictionary of the CameraProperties attributes."""
```

- `exposure_time_us`: How long in microseconds your camera should collect light from the sample. However, for simulated cameras, this is just a waiting period before generating the next frame.

- `line_interval_us`: The time to scan one line in microseconds in a rolling shutter camera.

- `binning`: How many adjacent pixels in each direction to combine by averaging. If binning is set to 1, no pixels will be combined.

- `shape`: A tuple of two integers representing the shape of the camera detector in pixels.

- `input_triggers`: An instance of the `InputTriggers` class.

- `output_triggers`: An instance of the `OutputTriggers` class.

- The `dict` method create a dictionary of a `CameraProperties` object's attributes.

## Class `ChunkingProperties`

```python
class ChunkingProperties:
    max_bytes_per_chunk: int
    tile: TileShape

    def dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]: ...
    """Returns a dictionary of the ChunkingProperties attributes."""

    def dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]: ...
    """Returns a dictionary of the Trigger attributes."""
```

- `edge`: An instance of the `TriggerEdge` class specifying if the trigger is on the rising or falling edge trigger signal.

- `enable`: A boolean indicating whether the trigger is enabled.

- `line`: An integer representing the line of the trigger signal.

- `kind`: An instance of the `SignalIOKind` class specifying if the signal is input or output.

- The `dict` method creates a dictionary of a `Trigger` object's attributes.

## Class `TriggerEdge`

The `TriggerEdge` class represents what edge of the trigger function initiates the trigger.

```python
class TriggerEdge:
    Falling: ClassVar[TriggerEdge] = TriggerEdge.Falling
    NotApplicable: ClassVar[TriggerEdge] = TriggerEdge.NotApplicable
    Rising: ClassVar[TriggerEdge] = TriggerEdge.Rising

    def __eq__(self, other: object) -> bool:
        """Checks if two TriggerEdge objects are equal."""
        
    def __ge__(self, other: object) -> bool:
        """Checks if this TriggerEdge is greater than or equal to another."""
        
    def __gt__(self, other: object) -> bool:
        """Checks if this TriggerEdge is greater than another."""
        
    def __int__(self) -> int:
        """Converts the TriggerEdge to an integer."""
        
    def __le__(self, other: object) -> bool:
        """Checks if this TriggerEdge is less than or equal to another."""
        
    def __lt__(self, other: object) -> bool:
        """Checks if this TriggerEdge is less than another."""
        
    def __ne__(self, other: object) -> bool:
        """Checks if two TriggerEdge objects are not equal."""
```

- `Falling`: Class variable of `TriggerEdge` that defines the falling edge of the trigger. 

- `NotApplicable`: Class variable of `TriggerEdge` that defines if a trigger does not have a rising or falling edge.

- `Rising`: Class variable of `TriggerEdge` that defines the rising edge of the trigger.

## Class `VideoFrame` 

The `VideoFrame` class represents data from acquisition of a frame.

```python
class VideoFrame:
    def data(self) -> NDArray[Any]:
        """Returns the data of the video frame as an NDArray."""
    
    def metadata(self) -> VideoFrameMetadata:
        """Returns the metadata associated with the video frame."""
```

- Call `data()` to create an NDArray of the `VideoFrame` data. 

- Call `metadata()` to query the metadata of `VideoFrame`. 

## Class `VideoFrameMetadata`

The `VideoFrameMetadata` class represents metadata related to a video frame.

```python
class VideoFrameMetadata:
    frame_id: int
    timestamps: VideoFrameTimestamps

    def dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]: ...
    """Returns a dictionary of the VideoFrameMetadata attributes."""
```

- `frame_id`: An integer representing the ID of the video frame.

- `timestamps`: An instance of the `VideoFrameTimestamps` class specifying whether the video timestamps are based on the hardware clock or the acquisition clock.

- The `dict` method creates a dictionary of a `VideoFrameTimestamps` object's attributes.

## Class `VideoFrameTimestamps`

The `VideoFrameTimestamps` class represents timestamps related to a video frame.

```python
class VideoFrameTimestamps:
    hardware: int
    acq_thread: int

    def dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]: ...
    """Returns a dictionary of the VideoFrameTimestamps attributes."""
```

- `hardware`: An integer representing hardware timestamps.

- `acq_thread`: An integer representing timestamps from the acquisition thread.

- The `dict` method creates a dictionary of a `VideoFrameTimestamps` object's attributes.

## Class `VideoStream`

The `VideoStream` class represents a video stream.

```python
class VideoStream:
    camera: Camera
    storage: Storage
    max_frame_count: int
    frame_average_count: int

    def dict(self) -> Dict[str, Any]: ...
    """Returns a dictionary of the VideoStream attributes."""
```

- `camera`: An instance of the `Camera` class representing the camera used in the video stream.

- `storage`: An instance of the `Storage` class representing the storage settings for the video stream.

- `max_frame_count`: An integer representing the maximum number of frames in the video stream.

- `frame_average_count`: An integer representing the number of frames to average in the video stream.

- The `dict` method creates a dictionary of a `VideoStream` object's attributes.

## Class `VoltageRange`

The `VoltageRange` class represents a range of voltage values.

```python
class VoltageRange:
    mn: float
    mx: float

    @overload
    def __init__(self) -> None: ...
    """Initializes a VoltageRange object"""

    @overload
    def __init__(self, mn: float, mx: float) -> None: ...
    """Initializes a VoltageObject object with mn and mx provided."""

    def dict(self) -> Dict[str, float]: ...
    """Returns a dictionary of the VoltageRange attributes."""
```

- `mn`: A float representing the minimum voltage value.

- `mx`: A float representing the maximum voltage value.

- The `dict` method creates a dictionary of a `VoltageRange` object's attributes.
